This repository holds the progress I have made thus far in Project Euler. 


# What is Project Euler 
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." - https://projecteuler.net/
